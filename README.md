# Overview

I wanted to get more familular with react and what it can do. With this project, I just scraped the surface of what react is cabible of and it was really cool to see how everything can connect in a web application. My web page writes out routes that I want to do at the city of rocks. When you click the "x" then the routes is done and dissapears.

# Development Environment

To start react I had to download react application in VS code. I used Node to run my envirement. THis was very useful to use and work with. I counld easily install it and run it on my computer. I created a basic react app then add the deleted stuff to tailor it to my needs.
